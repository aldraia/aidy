SUMMARY="LADI Session Handler is a session management system for JACK applications
on GNU/Linux."
DESCRIPTION="
Aims to allow you to have many different audio programs running at once, to save their setup,
close them down and then easily reload the setup at some other time. ladish doesn't deal with any
kind of audio or MIDI data itself; it just runs programs, deals with saving/loading (arbitrary) data
and connects JACK ports together. It can also be used to move entire sessions between computers, or
post sessions on the Internet for download.
